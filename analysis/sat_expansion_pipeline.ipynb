    "# SAT Expansion Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a method a segments-as-topic (SAT) methodology for generating new topics in the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) ontology. In the implementation below, a SAT comprises sections of national constitutions that capture the meaning of a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage gets things started and need only be run once during a session. It comprises three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Load packages and functions from external files.\n",
    "- Step 2: Start a web server that supports Javascript to Python interactions with the notebook.\n",
    "- Step 3: Load models. This includes Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) version 4 and the data models used by the application which include encodings of constitution sections generated by the USE model. These encodings are used by semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage initialises the data structures used to record your activities during a session. At the end of a session (SAT Review and Acceptance) the populated data structures are saved to a JSON file in the `outputs` folder. The file name is `<topic_key>_resources.json` and it provides a complete record of your activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SAT Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SAT generation stage, a topic formulation comprising a short phrase is created. A sentence-level semantic similarity model is then used to encode the topic formulation and the encoding is used to find constitution sections that are semantically similar to the topic formulation. Formulations can be tested and refined until a suitable seed set of segments is obtained. This SAT seed set is then used to find additional sections in the SAT Expansion stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps in this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Load an interface in which a topic key (a short identifier) and formulation are defined along with semantic search criteria.\n",
    "- Step 2: Use the choices made in the interface to search for constitution sections that are semantically similar to the topic formuation. Once the search is complete, select sections that you judge match the formulation. Alernatively, assess the results and return to Step 1 to refine your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SAT Generation is an iterative process, the final outcome of which is a set of accepted sections that constitute the SAT seed set which is the input to the SAT Exoansion stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAT Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps in this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Save the SAT seed set created by SAT Generation.\n",
    "- Step 2: Load an interface in which to define the two semantic similarity thresholds needed by SAT Expansion.\n",
    "- Step 3: Use the choices made in the interface to search for constitution sections that are semantically similar to SAT sections. Once the search is complete, select sections that you judge should be included in the SAT, i.e., expand the SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT Expansion is an iterative process, and by running Step 3 you can .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SAT Review and Acceptance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating a seed SAT set using PAT search in the CCP corpus\n",
    "2. Iteratively expanding the segments of a SAT.\n",
    "3. Reviewing and refining the expanded SAT.\n",
    "4. Automatically tagging SAT segments in constitution XML files.\n",
